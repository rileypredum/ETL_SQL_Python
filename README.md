# ETL_SQL_Python

A Jupyter Notebook exploring the idea of ETL in big data and data science, as well as using SQLAlchemy and raw SQL queries to explore the chinook.db database.

## Documentation and Getting Started

The file can be downloaded here: http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/

Getting started is quick and easy. All you need is the file above, and the notebook. You will need Python 3.x, pip, Pandas, and you'll need to install the package used if you don't already have them in your Python environment.

```{python}
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install pandas
```

Unzip the chinook.zip file into the working directory of your Jupyter Notebook, and then you're ready to connect the Sqlite engine and get started.
